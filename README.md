# Bluezy Dark Syntax Theme

Based on angular-dark-syntax, inspired by William D. Neumann's "Amy" theme in the [ColorSublime-Themes repository](https://github.com/Colorsublime/Colorsublime-Themes).

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_Syntax Themes_ dropdown menu.
